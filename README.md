# 📌 CMS Hospital Quality & Patient Experience Analysis

This is an end-to-end **Healthcare Analytics Project** using public datasets from **CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services)** to evaluate the quality of U.S. hospitals through **patient experience metrics (HCAHPS)** and **clinical outcome measures (Complications & Deaths)**. The project focuses on deriving meaningful insights that can support healthcare quality improvement and decision-making.

---

## 🏥 Project Overview
The project analyzes hospital performance based on patient satisfaction ratings, clinical safety indicators, and mortality/complication rates across U.S. hospitals. Using Python-based EDA, the study identifies high-performing and low-performing hospitals and highlights important trends across states and healthcare outcome measures.
